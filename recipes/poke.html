    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This easy poke recipe is a refreshing Hawaiian salad of fresh ahi tuna
      steak cubes tossed with soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions for a dish
      full of umami flavor. I like to add chopped macadamia nuts even though
      they are not authentic â€” they add a delicious crunch! This makes 4 main
      course servings or 8 appetizer servings.

      When you find yourself with fresh ahi tuna steaks, may we suggest you use
      them to make our delicious ahi poke recipe? Tuna poke is one of the
      easiest seafood dishes you can make (seriously, it only takes 15 minutes
      to prep) and you will never be disappointed by the rich umami flavors the
      fish has to offer.
